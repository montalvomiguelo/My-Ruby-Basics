Ruby Core contains the classes and modules that come with Ruby and make Ruby work. (Array, Hash, Fixnum, etc)

The Object and Kernel classes are the root of all Ruby class and object functionality.
Object is the base class that all Ruby classes inherit from. The Kernel module is included by the Object class
and contains methods that can be used in all classes.

Marshall class in Ruby Core allows you to convert Ruby object in to a data stream and back again

The Ruby Standard Library contains large pieces of functionallity and mus be specially imported into our programs.
